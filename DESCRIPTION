Title: Algebric Modeling Language for R
Version: 0.1.0
Author: John Lepird 
Maintainer: John Lepird <jlepird@mit.edu>
Description: Implements an algabraic modeling language in R. Building large 
    linear and mixed-integer programs by manually constructing matrices is 
    tedius, error-prone, and difficult for others to understand. This package
    alleviates this issue by allowing users to define their optimization problems
    in terms of variables and algabraic expressions, as one would do on a blackboard.
    Once the problem is defined, matrices are automatically constructed and passed
    to the user's available solver.
